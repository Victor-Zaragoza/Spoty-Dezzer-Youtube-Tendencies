for the last time\n\nIt’s me\nHi\nI’m the problem, it’s me\nAt teatime\nEverybody agrees\nI’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n\nSometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby\nAnd I’m a monster on the hill\nToo big to hang out\nSlowly lurching toward your favorite city\nPierced through the heart but never killed\nDid you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman \nTale as old as time\nI wake up screaming from dreaming \none day I’ll watch as you’re leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time \n\nIt’s me\nHi\nI’m the problem, it’s me\nAt teatime\nEverybody agrees\nI’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n\nI have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money\nShe thinks I left them in the will\nThe family gathers ‘round and reads it\nAnd then someone screams out\n“She’s laughing up at us from hell!”\n\nIt’s me\nHi\nI’m the problem, it’s me\n\nIt’s me\nHi\nI’m the problem, it’s me\n\nIt’s me\nHi\n\nEverybody agrees\nEverybody agrees\n\nIt’s me\nHi\nI’m the problem, it’s me\nAt teatime\nEverybody agrees\nI’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n\nDirector: Taylor Swift\nDirector of Photography: Rina Yang\nProducer: Sara D'Alessio\nEditor: Chancler Haynes\nProduction Designer: Ethan Tobman\n1st AD: Anthony Dimino\nVisual Effects: Parliament\nProduction Companies: Taylor Swift Productions & Revolution Pictures\n\n#taylorswift #midnights #antihero \n\nMusic video by Taylor Swift performing Anti-Hero. © 2022 Taylor Swift","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b1kbLwvqugk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b1kbLwvqugk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b1kbLwvqugk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b1kbLwvqugk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b1kbLwvqugk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Chillax","playlistId":"PLDIoUOhQQPlU2NpvlGKTsQRoCMHTUCLMf","position":0,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"b1kbLwvqugk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"TaylorSwiftVEVO","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCANLZYMidaCbLQFWXBC95Jg"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"b1kbLwvqugk","videoPublishedAt":"2022-10-21T12:00:06Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"NH-kAo-SqPN4RunTc3CAZgFUL-E","id":"UExESW9VT2hRUVBsVTJOcHZsR0tUc1FSb0NNSFRVQ0xNZi43OTVFMThENjZGOEUwMzQw","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-10-29T19:52:10Z","channelId":"UCX9oPuvJYZsG8wnHTwOBVPA","title":"Rihanna -

After seeing \"Slave For You,\" I decided that I wanted to become a video director. Elton John is an icon that I and the world grew up listening to,” On the creative direction, Muino continued, \"Going into this video, I knew there would be a lot of emotional expectations the audience and fans would have. With this responsibility, I had to do something different and unexpected. The dance had to be forward-thinking to raise eyebrows and make Elton and Britney proud. To capture this magic, we shot around all my favorite architectural locations in Mexico City and brought on choreographer Jacob Jonas who does the best contemporary choreography today. Getting the best dancers, crew, and access to some of the most private locations in the world was simple as everyone wanted to work with Elton John and be part of his legacy.\"\n\nProd Co: UnderWonder Content\nProducers: Robert Katz, Frank Borin, Ivana Borin \nDirector: Tanu Muino\n\nWatch more Elton videos: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WatchMore\nSubscribe to Elton channel: http://bit.ly/EltonYTSubscribe \n\nFollow Elton John on...\nFacebook: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/facebookYT \nTwitter: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/twitterYT \nInstagram: https://eltonjohn.lnk.to/instaYT \nOfficial Website: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/WebsiteOfficial \nJoin the Rocket Club newsletter: https://EltonJohn.lnk.to/RocketClub \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/EltonJohn","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qExVlz3zb0k/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Chillax","playlistId":"PLDIoUOhQQPlU2NpvlGKTsQRoCMHTUCLMf","position":3,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"qExVlz3zb0k"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"EltonJohnVEVO","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCI8Ry7NdFNLel-S8dWU7mDA"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"qExVlz3zb0k","videoPublishedAt":"2022-09-27T17:00:11Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"A7s9kJeSeegxEZl6MammMNGbjuU","id":"UExESW9VT2hRUVBsVTJOcHZsR0tUc1FSb0NNSFRVQ0xNZi43MkFGRUJCMUI3NzVERTg2","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-11-08T21:56:16Z","channelId":"UCX9oPuvJYZsG8wnHTwOBVPA","title":"Joji -

It’s why in just one year’s time, he’s already logged over 400 million global streams, notched two entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and immediately sold out his first headline tour. Growing up in the small town of Louisville, IL, Zimmerman embraced country music on long-haul truck rides with his dad, and 80’s hair rock at home with his mom. By the time he hit high school, Zimmerman learned old school American values of hard work and dependability through a gig at the local meat market and long hours on a union gas pipeline. Simultaneously, he discovered his natural musical talent and began to sing whenever there was a guitar nearby. After a garage-recorded demo of his song “Never Comin’ Home” amassed over a million plays overnight, he turned in his union card to fulfill a growing demand for new music. Zimmerman fueled his meteoric rise with anthemic singles including, “Fall In Love”, “Rock and A  Hard Place”, and “Where It Ends”. Now, this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter has arrived at the cusp of superstardom as he readies his forthcoming debut for Warner Music Nashville/Elektra Records.\n\n#BaileyZimmerman #FallInLove #RockAndAHardPlace","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyapQFCHUlg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyapQFCHUlg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyapQFCHUlg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyapQFCHUlg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyapQFCHUlg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Chillax","playlistId":"PLDIoUOhQQPlU2NpvlGKTsQRoCMHTUCLMf","position":33,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"QyapQFCHUlg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Bailey Zimmerman","videoOwnerChannelId":"UC2I1O7O6e8BDSXatTCpYBgQ"},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"QyapQFCHUlg","videoPublishedAt":"2022-06-24T15:00:11Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"HQl0ctq7AhQoTDLgTurZR_Wsjus","id":"UExESW9VT2hRUVBsVTJOcHZsR0tUc1FSb0NNSFRVQ0xNZi5CMTEyQTcwMTJBNUNBN0Q4","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-09-25T17:23:36Z","channelId":"UCX9oPuvJYZsG8wnHTwOBVPA","title":"Lil Nas X - STAR WALKIN' (League of Legends Worlds Anthem)","description":"THE ONE & ONLY WORLDS MUSIC VIDEO.
